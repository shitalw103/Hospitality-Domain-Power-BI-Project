**🏨 Hospitality Domain Power BI Project**
**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on solving key business challenges in the hospitality industry using Power BI.
I built an interactive dashboard to analyze hotel performance across multiple properties and provide actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

**🛑 Problem Statement**

Hospitality businesses often struggle with:

Tracking occupancy, revenue, and cancellations across multiple properties.

Understanding weekday vs weekend performance.

Identifying which room types or booking platforms drive higher realization and ADR.

Getting a consolidated view to support decision-making in real time.

**✅ Solutio**

I designed a Power BI dashboard that provides:

Key Metrics at a glance – Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy%, ADR, Realisation%, DSRN.

Property-level insights – Compare performance of each hotel by revenue, cancellations, and ratings.

Category & Trend Analysis – Revenue split by luxury vs business segment, and weekly trends.

Weekday vs Weekend performance – To identify demand patterns.

Booking Platform Insights – See realization% and ADR across different channels.
