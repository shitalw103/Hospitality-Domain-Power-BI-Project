**🛑 Problem**
<br>Hospitality businesses often struggle with:
<br>Tracking occupancy, revenue, and cancellations across multiple properties.
<br>Understanding weekday vs weekend performance.
<br>Identifying which room types or booking platforms drive higher realization and ADR.
<br>Getting a consolidated view to support decision-making in real time.

<br>**✅ Solution**
<br>I designed a Power BI dashboard that provides:
<br>Key Metrics at a glance – Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy%, ADR, Realisation%, DSRN.
<br>Property-level insights – Compare performance of each hotel by revenue, cancellations, and ratings.
<br>Category & Trend Analysis – Revenue split by luxury vs business segment, and weekly trends.
<br>Weekday vs Weekend performance – To identify demand patterns.
<br>Booking Platform Insights – See realization% and ADR across different channels.
